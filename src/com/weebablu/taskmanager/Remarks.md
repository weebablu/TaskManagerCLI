This App has the following features now:
<br>
1. Add task
2. ViewAllTasks
3. MarkAsDone
4. DeleteTask
5. FilterTasks
6. Undo
7. Redo
<br>
& So far, everything looks fine and the services are up to the mark.
<br>
<br>
Concerns:<br>
1. The description attribute should be used and shouldn't be left like that.<br>
2. App needs Formatting and Designing.<br>
3. Then we can shift gears and Refactor things using interfaces and abstract methods, and build better Architecture.
